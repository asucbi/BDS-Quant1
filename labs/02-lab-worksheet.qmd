## Purpose

The purpose of today's lab is to: (1) visualize the Central Limit Theorem, and (2) practice the steps of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST).

## Access the Starter Files for Module 2

-   Go to [posit.cloud](posit.cloud) and then **navigate to the course workspace** via the left sidebar.

    -   Look for the course workspace called "Statistical Methods Spring 2025"

-   Open the project titled **Module 2** This module contains the starter files that you will use for this lab and for your homework.

## Starter Files

In the Files pane you should see these two R Notebooks:

-   mod-02-lab-starter.qmd
-   mod-02-hw-starter.qmd

Go ahead and open up `mod-02-lab-starter.qmd`. This is your "starter file" for today's lab. You will build upon this document as you work on the exercises in this lab session.

## Step 1: Check that the file Renders!

Click the button called "Render" (circled in the image below) and then double check to see that your document rendered in the **Viewer** pane. It is always a good idea to occasionally check that the document still renders correctly after making changes.

## Step 2: Load Packages

Today, we'll be using the following packages:

-   **tidyverse**: a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way
-   **infer**: a package designed for statistical inference, we will be using it to generate "sample" datasets
-   **knitr**: a package that supports the integration of code into text documents, we will be using it today to create a table

Please load these packages using the `library()` function. If the packages don't load, you may need to `install.packages()` first.

```{r load-packages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse); library(infer)
```

## Step 3: Read in the Data

The data we will use in Module 2 is from the Gapminder Foundation, a non-profit collects data about social, economic, and environmental development at local, national, and global levels. The data we will use today were collected in 2015.

Read in the data using the `read_csv()` function. Name the data "gapminder_2015"

```{r read in data, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
gapminder_2015 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_2015.csv")
```

Now, use the `View()` function to take a look at your data.

## Exercise 1:

For this first exercise, we are going to generate 10000 random samples of different sizes (5, 30, and 100) from a skewed distribution. For each sample, we will calculate the mean. Then, we will plot those 1000 means to examine the resulting sampling distributions. We will use the (depressing, sorry!) infant_mortality variable in the gapminder data. 

Compare the three plots, what does this show?

## Exercise 2:

Now, let's practice the steps of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST). 

:::callout-note
There is no data to read in for this exercise. 
:::

A psychologist is investigating the impact of a new mindfulness meditation technique on stress levels. It is known that the average stress score on a well-validated scale is 75 for the general population.

The psychologist recruits 25 participants to undergo the mindfulness meditation program for 8 weeks. After the program, the participants complete the standardized stress scale. The sample of participants has an average stress score of 68 with a standard deviation of 12. 

**Step 1:** State the null and alternative hypotheses. Use _non-directional_ hypotheses.

H~0~:

H~1~:

**Step 2:** Choose your alpha level. If you choose not to use $\alpha$ = .05, provide a justification.

$\alpha$: 

**Step 3:** Collect your data.

We're going to pretend we already did this! 

Restating from above: Our sample mean is 68 and sample standard deviation is 12. The population mean is 75. 

$\bar{x}$ = 68

_s_ = 12

$\mu$ = 75

**Step 4:** Define the mean and SEM for the sampling distribution. Estimate the population mean and sd from your data, calculate the SEM. Report the SEM.

_SEM_ = $\sigma$ / $\sqrt{n}$

:::callout-note
Note: While we are calculating these statistics for practice, and to generate a confidence interval, we will use a t-distribution to generate the _exact_ p-value for our observed data. You should always report the exact p-value if you can unless it's under .001. In that case, you would report _p_ < .001. 
:::

**Step 5:** Determine the probability of your data or more extreme under the null distribution. Calculate the t-statistic and then generate a p-value using the `pt()` function.

_t_ = ($\bar{x}$ - $\mu$) / _SEM_

**Step 6:** Compare your probability (p-value) to your alpha level and decide whether to reject or retain the null hypothesis. 

**Step 7:** Write up your results summary. Make sure to include a Confidence Interval around your estimate of the mean. 

95% CI = $\bar{x}$ &pm;(1.96 x SEM)

Make sure to include the following in your results summary:

  *   <span style="color: blue;">A brief statement about what you tested.<span>
  *   <span style="color: orange;">Descriptive statistics for your sample(s), including the confidence intervall around your estimate.<span>
  *   <span style="color: green;">A statement of the direction of the effect.<span>
  *   <span style="color: hotpink;">Descriptives for the value or group you are comparing your sample to.<span> 
  *   <span style="color: purple;">Results of the statistical test you performed, written in APA Style (including statistic and p-value).<span>
  *   <span style="color: turquoise;">A clear statement about what you found.<span>

:::callout-note
The items listed above do not need to be included in this exact order.

```{r values for summary, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
population_mean <- 75
sample_mean <- 68
estimated_sigma <- 12
sample_size <- 25
SEM <- estimated_sigma / sqrt(sample_size)
t_statistic <- (sample_mean - population_mean) / SEM
df_value <- sample_size - 1
p_value <- 2*pt(abs(t_statistic), df = df_value, lower.tail = FALSE)
lower_bound <- round(sample_mean - (1.96*SEM), 2)
upper_bound <- round(sample_mean + (1.96*SEM), 2)
```

<span style="color: blue;">We examined the effect of an 8-week mindfulness meditation program on stress levels.<span> <span style="color: orange;">The average score of participants after the program (_M_ = `r sample_mean`, 95%CI [`r lower_bound`, `r upper_bound`], _SD_ = `r estimated_sigma`)<span> <span style="color: green;">was significantly higher than the population average,<span> <span style="color: hotpink;">($\mu$ = `r population_mean`)<span>, <span style="color: purple;">_t_(`r df_value`) = `r round(t_statistic, 2)`, _p_ = `r round(p_value, 3)`.<span> <span style="color: turquoise;">This finding suggests that the mindfulness meditation program has a significant impact on reducing stress levels in participants.<span>

## Consider the following alternative scenarios. What would you conclude?

If observed sample mean was 72, the t statistic would be -1.25 and p-value would be 0.22. What do you conclude?

If the observed sample mean was 82, the t statistic would be 2.92 and p-value would be .008. What do you conclude?
