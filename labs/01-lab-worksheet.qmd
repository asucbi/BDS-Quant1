## Purpose

The purpose of today's lab is to review how to calculate and visualize descriptive statistics in R. This will not be a deep dive into the theoretical meaning behind descriptives, but rather a guide to some practical steps toward getting the most basic summary information out of a given dataset.

## Access the Starter Files for Module 1

-   Go to [posit.cloud](posit.cloud) and then **navigate to the course workspace** via the left sidebar.

    -   Look for the course workspace called "Statistical Methods Spring 2025"

-   Open the project titled **Module 1** This module contains the starter files that you will use for this lab and for your homework.

## Starter Files

In the Files pane you should see these two R Notebooks:

-   mod-01-lab-starter.qmd
-   mod-01-hw-starter.qmd

Go ahead and open up `mod-01-lab-starter.qmd`. This is your "starter file" for today's lab. You will build upon this document as you work on the exercises in this lab session.

## Step 1: Update the YAML

In the YAML at the top of your .qmd file, change the author name to your name and put in today's date.

## Step 2: Render it!

Click the button called "Render" (circled in the image below) and then double check to see that your document rendered in the **Viewer** pane. It is always a good idea to occasionally check that the document still renders correctly after making changes.

## Step 3: Load Packages

Today, we'll be using the following packages:

-   **tidyverse**: a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way
-   **knitr**: a package that supports the integration of code into text documents, we will be using it today to create a table
-   **moments**: a package that calculates skewness and kurtosis

Please load these packages using the `library()` function. You may need to install the `knitr` and `moments` libraries.

```{r load-packages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Step 4: Read in the Data

The data we will use in Module 1 is from the [2015 World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2015/), an annual survey part of the [Gallup World Poll](https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx).

Read in the data using the `read_csv()` function. Name the data "world."

```{r read in data, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
world <- read_csv("data/world_happiness_2015.csv")
```

::: callout-note
If you are having trouble reading in the data, remember that they are in the `data` folder!
:::

Now, use the `View()` function to take a look at your data.

::: callout-important
Why should we always take a look at the data after reading it in?

## Exercise 1:

Calculate (individually) the mean, median, variance and standard deviation of the "Happiness" variable using the corresponding function in R. Please use these functions:

`mean()` `median()` `var()` `sd()`

Save your values as variables, as we'll be using them in our write-up!

Now, create a table of these values.

There are some nice instructions on the [Quarto Website](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html) that cover the creation of tables.

## Exercise 2:

Construct a summary of the "Happiness" variable that contains each of the above parameters.

Turn this summary into a table that renders nicely in your final document.

The function `kable` in the `knitr` package is a nice option for creating tables from r objects. More information about this function is available [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html).

## Exercise 3:

Create a histogram of the "Happiness" variable. Make sure to label your plot.

What do the descriptive statistics and histogram suggest about the shape of the "Happiness" distribution? Is it normally distributed or skewed in one direction? How can you tell?

## Exercise 4:

Now, let's examine the skew and kurtosis of the distribution!

First, we need to install and load the `moments` package.

Next, we can use the `skewness()` and `kurtosis()` functions to calculate these values.

Again, save your values as variables, as we'll be using them in the write-up!

::: callout-tip
**Skewness:** Though this is counter-intuitive, **negative skewness** is indicated by **higher** (positive) values, while positive skewness is indicated by **lower** (negative) values. A skewness value between -1 and +1 is excellent, -2 to +2 suggest moderate skewness, and values beyond -2 or +2 suggest substantial non-normality.

**Kurtosis:** **Positive** kurtosis values indicate a **more peaked** distribution, while **negative** kurtosis values indicate a **flatter** distribution. Kurtosis values greater than +2 suggest that the distribution is too peaked and values lower than -2 suggest that the distribution is too flat.

For both skew and kurtosis, a normal distribution would have a value of 0.
:::

## Exercise 5:

Write up a summary of what you found. Make sure to include information about which measure of central tendency is most appropriate given the distribution. Use the variables you created earlier to insert the descriptive values directly into your summary.

## Render your document.

Note: You do not need to submit your lab, but you will need to submit a rendered PDF version of your homework to "Module 1: Homework Submission" on Canvas.

-   In the YAML, change "format: html" to "format: pdf"
-   Click "Render" at the top of the document
-   If you get a popup warning, click "Try Again" (may be specific to Mac)
-   Click the "Save" icon on the top right (circled in the image below) 

![](images/save_pdf.png)

-   Save wherever you keep your class documents and upload your file to Canvas
