For this module's lab (and homework), I would like to see your code in the final document. So, make sure you haven't hidden any of your code (i.e., by using `echo=FALSE`) in your code chunks.

## Load Packages

Note: you may have to install these packages first.

```{r load-packages, message= FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)

```

## Read in the Data; View the Data

```{r read-and-view, message= FALSE}

world <- read_csv("data/world_happiness_2015.csv")

View(world)

```

## Exercise 1:

Calculate (individually) the mean, median, variance and standard deviation of the "Happiness" variable using the corresponding function in R. Please use these functions:

`mean()` `median()` `var()` `sd()`

Save your values as objects, as we'll be using them in our write-up!

Now, create a table of these values.

```{r happiness-descriptives}

mean_happiness <- mean_happiness <- mean(world$Happiness, na.rm = TRUE)
median_happiness <- median(world$Happiness, na.rm = TRUE)
var_happiness <- var(world$Happiness, na.rm = TRUE)
sd_happiness <- sd(world$Happiness, na.rm = TRUE)

# sanity check: is the sd equal to the sqrt of the variance

sqrt(var_happiness)

sd_happiness == sqrt(var_happiness)

```

Create a table using the objects you created.

The code below is for a **pipe table**. However there are *many* ways to create tables. The [Quarto Website](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html) has some nice instructions that go more in depth about the creation of tables

Notice that I am creating the table within my text, and not in the code chunk.

Template:

| Statistic          |             Value |
|--------------------|------------------:|
| Mean               | \[insert r code\] |
| Median             | \[insert r code\] |
| Variance           | \[insert r code\] |
| Standard Deviation | \[insert r code\] |

: Happiness Descriptives {.striped .hover}

### 

Finished Version:

| Statistic          |                          Value |
|--------------------|-------------------------------:|
| Mean               |   `r round(mean_happiness, 2)` |
| Median             | `r round(median_happiness, 2)` |
| Variance           |     `r round(sd_happiness, 2)` |
| Standard Deviation |    `r round(var_happiness, 2)` |

: Happiness Descriptives {.striped .hover}

Render your document to see that the table renders correctly.

## Exercise 2:

Construct a **summary** of the "Happiness" variable that contains each of the above parameters.

Turn this summary into a table that renders nicely in your final document.

```{r happiness-summary}

# multiple ways to do it, this is one example!
world %>% 
  summarise(mean = mean(Happiness, na.rm = TRUE),
            median = median(Happiness, na.rm = TRUE),
            variance = var(Happiness, na.rm = TRUE),
            standard_deviation = sd(Happiness, na.rm = TRUE))

summary <- world %>% 
  summarise(mean = round(mean(Happiness, na.rm = TRUE),2),
            median = round(median(Happiness, na.rm = TRUE),2),
            variance = round(var(Happiness, na.rm = TRUE),2),
            standard_deviation = round(sd(Happiness, na.rm = TRUE),2))

knitr::kable(summary)

knitr::kable(t(summary))

```

## Exercise 3:

Create a histogram of the "Happiness" variable. Make sure to label your plot.

What do the descriptive statistics and histogram suggest about the shape of the "Happiness" distribution? Is it normally distributed or skewed in one direction? How can you tell?

It looks relatively normal.

```{r histogram}

world %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = Happiness)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  labs(title = "World Happiness Ratings in 2015")


```

## Exercise 4:

Now, let's examine the skew and kurtosis of the distribution!

First, we need to install and load the `moments` package.

Next, we can use the `skewness()` and `kurtosis()` functions to calculate these values.

Again, save your values as objects, as we'll be using them in the write-up!

```{r skew-kurtosis}

# type your code here




###
library(moments)

skew_happiness <- world %>% 
  select(Happiness) %>% 
  skewness(na.rm=TRUE)

skewness(world$Happiness, na.rm = TRUE)

kurtosis_happiness <- world %>% 
  select(Happiness) %>% 
  kurtosis(na.rm=TRUE)


```

## Exercise 5:

Write up a summary of what you found. Make sure to include information about which measure of central tendency is most appropriate given the distribution. Use the objects you created earlier to insert the descriptive values directly into your summary.

### 

In the 2015 World Happiness Report, the average Happiness rating is `r round(mean_happiness, 2)`. The median Happiness rating is `r round(median_happiness, 2)`, the variance in Happiness ratings is `r round(var_happiness, 2)`, and the standard deviation is `r round(sd_happiness, 2)`. A histogram of the data reveals an approximately normally distribution. While the skewness of `r round(skew_happiness, 2)` is close to zero and suggests an approximately normal distribution, the kurtosis is slightly high at `r round(kurtosis_happiness, 2)`. Thus, for these data, the mean would be the most appropriate measure of central tendency.


Here is a screenshot of what this summary looks like in R code:

![](images/R_code_summary.png)

```{r}
```

Student Question: How does the `skewness()` function calculate the skew? What is the equation?

There are multiple equations to calculate skew, the one that the `moments` package uses is:

```{r student-question, eval = FALSE}

skewness = (sum((x - mean(x))^3) / n) / (sum((x - mean(x))^2) / n)^(3/2)

We can try out this equation.

x <- world$Happiness 
n <- nrow(world)

skew_happiness_calc <- (sum((x - mean(x))^3) / n) / (sum((x - mean(x))^2) / n)^(3/2)


```
