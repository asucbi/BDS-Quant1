# Purpose

In today's lab, we will practice centering, standardizing, and log transforming data. We will also work with polynonial data and, for all topics, we will discuss interpretation.

For today's lab, you will need to load the following libraries.

```{r libraries, message=FALSE}

library(tidyverse)
library(papaja) #for formatting p values
library(knitr) #for formatting tables
library(psych) #for generating easy descriptives
library(effectsize) #for generating effect sizes
library(performance) #for checking multicollinaerity

```

# Research scenario

For the first part of today's lab, we will be examining predictors of population size in the US.

## Read in the data

First, let's read in the data and then use `View()` to check it out.

Today's dataset is called `pop_predictors.csv`. Let's read it in and name it `pop`.

```{r read-and-view, message= FALSE, echo=FALSE}

pop <- read_csv("data/pop_predictors.csv")

```

The data has 4 columns:

-   state: the state in which the data were collected
-   population: population size (in the late 80s / early 90s)
-   income: average income (in the late 80s / early 90s)
-   winter: average temperature during winter months

# We should always examine our data first! 

Let's start by using the `describe()` function in the `{psych}` package to examine our data.

```{r describe, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}


```

> **Question: What do you noticed about the means and standard deviations of our variables? ...range? ...scale?**

# Centering

First, without doing any transformations, run a model predicting population from income. Get a summary of your model.

```{r pop-income, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

model <- lm(population ~ income, data = pop)
summary(model)

```

> **Question: How would you interpret the intercept? Is this meaningful?**

Now, let's center the income variable and re-run the regression.

```{r centered, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

#first, create the income variable
pop <- pop %>% 
  mutate(income_c = XXX))

#check out your data - what do you notice? what might have happened?
pop

# STOP HERE








#let's try again!
pop <- pop %>% 
  mutate(income_c = XXX))

#check out the data again -- much better!
pop

#now, run the model
model_2 <- lm(population ~ income_c, data = pop)
summary(model_2)

```
> **Question: How would you interpret the intercept? Is this meaningful?**


> **Question: How would you interpret the slope?**


Now, let's try a multiple regression. Predict population from income centered and winter temperature. Get a summary of your model.

```{r multi-regression, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

model_3 <- lm(XXX)
summary(model_3)

```

> **Question: How would you interpret the intercept? Is this meaningful?**


> **Question: How would you interpret the slope for income_c?**


> **Question: How would you interpret the slope for winter?**


> **Question: How would you summarize your findings?**


Now, let's get confidence intervals and effect sizes for each of our predictors.

We get CIs using the `confint()` function and effect size using `eta_squared` in the `{effectsize}` package. We want eta squared, NOT partial eta squared. How would you specify that in the function? (hint: check out the `help` info)

```{r effect-size, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

confint(model_3)

eta_squared(model_3, XXX)

```

# Standardizing

Now, let's say we want to know whether income or winter temperature is the stronger predictor of population. In the previous model, we found the the expected increase in population for a one-unit increase in income (holding winter temp constant) is 0.38 and the expected increase for a one-unit increase in winter temp (holding income constant) is 206.65. However, because these measures are on different scales, we can't say that the effect of temperature is bigger just because the value is larger. To make this comparison possible, we can *scale* our variables.

First, let's z-score each of our variables.
```{r z-scores, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

pop <- pop %>% 
  mutate(income_z = XXX,
         winter_z = XXX)

#let's look at the descriptives again, too
describe(pop)

```
Next, run a regression predicting population from the z-scored variables you just created. Check out a summary.

```{r stand-reg, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}

model_4 <- lm(population ~ XXX + XXX, data = pop)
summary(model_4)

```
> **Question: How would you interpret the intercept?**


> **Question: How would you interpret the effect of income?**


> **Question: How would you interpret the effect of winter?**


> **Question: Which is the stronger predictor?**


Compare the summary for your current model (model_4) to the summary for the previous model (model_3). 

```{r compare-summaries, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

summary(model_4)
summary(model_3)

```
> **Question: What changes? What stays the same?**


# Log Transformation

Now, let's focus on the effect of winter temperature on population size. 

First, let's look at the distribution of our variables.

```{r examine-dist, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

pop %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = population)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Population Size")

pop %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = winter)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of Winter Temperature")

```
> **Question: Which variable might we want to log transform? Why?**


Log transform the population variable, then examine the distribution again.

```{r log-population, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

pop <- pop %>% 
  mutate(population_log = XXX)

pop %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = XXX)) +
  geom_histogram() +
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Histogram of (Log) Population Size")

```
> **Question: How does the data distribution look now?**


Now, run a regression predicting population from winter temperature. Examine the summary.

```{r log-regression, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

model_5 <- lm(population_log ~ winter, data = pop)
summary(model_5)

```
> **Question: What do you need to do before you can interpret the effect of winter temp on population?**


Recall that: 

$log_b(n) = x \leftrightarrow b^x = n$

To interpret the intercept, use the `exp()` function to put the outcome variable back into original units. 

```{r interpret-intercept, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

exp(XXX)

```
> **Question: How would you interpret the intercept?**


Now, use the following steps to interpret the slope:

  1.  expotentiate the coefficient
  2.  subtract one from this number
  3.  multiply by zero to get a percentage

For every one-unit increase in our predictor, our dependent variable increases/decreases by this percent.
```{r interpret-slope, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

#expotentiate the coefficient
winter_exp <- exp(XXX)

#subtract one from this number, then multiply by 100
(XXX-1)*100

```

# Polynomials

# Research scenario

Using cross-sectional data, we will examine the development (change and/or stability) of conscientiousness in adulthood (age 21 to 60).  Based on previous research, we hypothesize that people will increase in conscientiousness with age; however, the rate of increase will be greatest during early adulthood (20s and 30s) and slow thereafter. 

> **Question: Which part of the above paragraph refers to a *linear* trend of age?**


> **Question: Which part of the above paragraph refers to a *quadratic* trend of age?**


## Read in the data

First, let's read in the data and then use `View()` to check it out.

Today's dataset is called `polynomial.csv`. Let's read it in and name it `polynomial`.

```{r read-and-view2, message= FALSE, echo=FALSE}

polynomial <- read_csv("data/polynomial.csv")

```

The data has 2 columns:

-   age: participant age
-   conscientiousness: score on conscientiousness measure

# We should always examine our data first! 

Let's start by plotting the relation between conscientiousness and age.

```{r plot-polynomial, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

polynomial %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = age, y = conscientiousness)) +
  geom_point()

```
> **Question: What do you notice about the relation between age and conscientiousness?**


Fist, we will examine a linear trend of age. Run a model predicting conscientiousness from age. Check out the summary.

```{r con-age-linear, , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

model_linear <- lm(conscientiousness ~ XXX, data = polynomial)
summary(model_linear)

```
> **Question: How would you interpret the intercept?**


> **Question: How would you interpret the slope?**


Even if we found a significant linear trend, we had a hypothesis about a quadratic, so let's test that! 

First, create the quadratic term. Then, run a model predicting conscientiousness from linear and quadratic effects of age. Check out the summary.

```{r con-age-quad, , echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

polynomial <- polynomial %>% 
  mutate(age_2 = XXX)

model_quad <- lm(conscientiousness ~ XXX + XXX, data = polynomial)
summary(model_quad)

```
> **Question: What can you say about the relation between conscientiousness and age?**


Let's test a cubic trend as well. Add a cubic term to your data (age^3) and run a third model. Check out the summary.

```{r con-age-cubic, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

polynomial <- polynomial %>% 
  mutate(age_3 = age^3)

model_cubic <- lm(conscientiousness ~ age + age_2 + age_3, data = polynomial)
summary(model_cubic)

```
> **Question: Which model would you choose?**


Let's compare our models using the `anova()` function and also examine the change in _R^2_ across our models.

```{r compare-models, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

anova(XXX, XXX, XXX)

summary(model_quad)$r.squared - summary(model_linear)$r.squared

summary(model_cubic)$r.squared - summary(model_quad)$r.squared

```
> **Question: Which model is the best fit for the data?**


BUT: Let's see if we have multicollinaerity issues with our chosen model. Use `check_collinaerity()` from the `{performance}` package to test the quadratic model.

```{r check-coll, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

check_collinearity(model_quad)

```
> **Question: Do we have a problem with multicollinaerity?**


Center your predictor, create the quadratic term, and run the model again. Check for multicollinaerity.

```{r quad-centered, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, eval=FALSE}

polynomial <- polynomial %>% 
  mutate(age_c = age-mean(age, na.rm =TRUE),
         age_c_2 = age_c^2)

model_quad_c <- lm(conscientiousness ~ age_c + age_c_2_c, data = polynomial)
summary(model_quad_c)

check_collinearity(model_quad_c)

```
> **Question: NOW, do we have a problem with multicollinaerity?**


> **Question: What is your final interpretation of the relation between age and conscientiousness?**


> **Question: What information would you include in a summary?**

-   clearly define the variables
-   describe the model
-   mention both linear and quadratic terms
-   report *overall* model fit ( _R_<sup>2</sup>, _F_, _df_, _p_-value)
-   report linear effect ( _b_, _SE_, _t_ statistic with associated _df_, 95%CI, _p_-value)
-   interpret linear effect (e.g., as x increases/decreases, y increases/decreases)
-   report quadratic effect ( _b_, _SE_, _t_ statistic with associated _df_, 95%CI, _p_-value)
-   interpret quadratic effect (e.g., the negative quadratic term suggests an inverted u-shape, where X increases with Y up to a point and then it decreases)
-   in one sentence, summarize what you found in non-statistical language
