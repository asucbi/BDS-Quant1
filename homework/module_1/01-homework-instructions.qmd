## Purpose

This week's homework is very simple. You will be asked to characterize distributions of data, just as you did in lab, and report your results. 

## Access the Starter Files for Module 1

-   Go to [posit.cloud](posit.cloud) and then **navigate to the course workspace** via the left sidebar.

    -   Look for the course workspace called "Statistical Methods Spring 2025"

-   Open the project titled **Module 1** This module contains the starter files that you will use for this lab and for your homework.

## Starter Files

In the Files pane you should see these two R Notebooks:

-   mod-01-lab-starter.qmd
-   mod-01-hw-starter.qmd

Go ahead and open up `mod-01-hw-starter.qmd`. 

## Update the YAML

In the YAML at the top of your .qmd file, change the author name to your name and put in today's date.

## Render it!

Click the button called "Render" (circled in the image below) and then double check to see that your document rendered in the **Viewer** pane. It is always a good idea to occasionally check that the document still renders correctly after making changes.

## Load Packages

Today, we'll be using the following packages:

-   **tidyverse**: a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way

Please load these packages using the `library()` function.

```{r load-packages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
```

## Step 4: Read in the Data

The data we will use in Module 1 is from the [2015 World Happiness Report](https://worldhappiness.report/ed/2015/), an annual survey part of the [Gallup World Poll](https://www.gallup.com/178667/gallup-world-poll-work.aspx).

Read in the data using the `read_csv()` function. Name the data "world."

```{r read in data, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
world <- read_csv("data/world_happiness_2015.csv")
```

::: callout-note
If you are having trouble reading in the data, remember that they are in the `data` folder!

Now, use the `View()` function to take a look at your data.

::: callout-important
Why should we always take a look at the data after reading it in?

## Exercise 1:

Calculate (individually) the mean, median, variance and standard deviation of the "Happiness" variable using the corresponding function in R. Please use these functions:

`mean()` `median()` `var()` `sd()`

Save your values as variables, as we'll be using them in our write-up!

Now, create a table of these values. 

There are some nice instructions on the [Quarto Website](https://quarto.org/docs/authoring/tables.html) that cover the creation of tables.

## Exercise 2:

Construct a summary of the "Happiness" variable that contains each of the above parameters.

Turn this summary into a table that renders nicely in your final document. 

The function `kable` in the `knitr` package is a nice option for creating tables from r objects. More information about this function is available [here](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/kable.html).

## Exercise 3:

Create a histogram of the "Happiness" variable. Make sure to label your plot.

*NEW*: Add a vertical line the indicates the location of the mean (solid red line) and median (dashed red line). Hint: use `geom_vline`.

What do the descriptive statistics and histogram suggest about the shape of the "Happiness" distribution? Is it normally distributed or skewed in one direction? How can you tell?

## Exercise 4:

Now, let's examine the skew and kurtosis of the distribution!

First, we need to install and load the `moments` package.

Next, we can use the `skewness()` and `kurtosis()` functions to calculate these values.

Again, save your values as variables, as we'll be using them in the write-up!

## Exercise 5:

Write up a summary of what you found. Make sure to include information about which measure of central tendency is most appropriate given the distribution. Use the variables you created earlier to insert the descriptive values directly into your summary.

## Exercise 6:

Choose one of the [Tidy Tuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/main) datasets and find a **continuous** variable that you would like to examine. Tell me the year and title of that dataset (e.g., 2021 - Netflix Titles). Repeat Exercises 1-5 for that variable. 

If you are working on this homework in a group, each member should please use a *different* dataset.

## Wrapping Up
