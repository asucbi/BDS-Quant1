## Purpose

In this week's homework, you will be asked to demonstrate your understanding of partial correlations and regression analysis.

## Access the Starter Files for Module 4

-   Go to [posit.cloud](posit.cloud) and then **navigate to the course workspace** via the left sidebar.

    -   Look for the course workspace called "Statistical Methods Spring 2025"

-   Open the project titled **Module 3** This module contains the starter files that you will use for this lab and for your homework.

## Starter Files

In the Files pane you should see these two R Notebooks:

-   mod-04-lab-starter.qmd
-   mod-04-hw-starter.qmd

Open up `mod-04-hw-starter.qmd`.

## Render it!

Click the button called "Render" (circled in the image below) and then double check to see that your document rendered in the **Viewer** pane. It is always a good idea to occasionally check that the document still renders correctly after making changes.

## Load Packages

Today, we'll be using the following packages:

-   **tidyverse**: a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way
-   **psych**: a package that provides various functions for psychological research and data analysis
-   **papaja**: a package that supports the formatting of APA style documents
-   **broom**: a package that turns R output into tidy tables
-   **knitr**: a package that supports the integration of code into text documents, we will be using it today to create a table

Please load these packages using the `library()` function. If the packages don't load, you may need to `install.packages()` first.

```{r load-packages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(papaja) #for formatting p values
library(broom) #for formatting tables
library(knitr) #for formatting tables
library(ppcor) #for calculating partial and correlations
library(easystats) #for assessing multicollinaerity
```

## Read in the Data

The dataset we will use comes from data from [Kay (2021)](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092656621000659). This paper examines why people believe in conspiracy theories.

The data is called `data_kay2021.csv`. Read in the data using the `read_csv()` function. Name the data "kay2021"

```{r read in data, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
kay2021 <- read_csv("data/data_kay2021.csv")
```

::: callout-note
If you are having trouble reading in the data, remember that they are in the `data` folder!

Now, use the `View()` function to take a look at your data.

## Exercise 1:

Say a researcher is interested in whether there is a relationship between the tendency to believe in conspiracy theories (Y = `conspiracy`) and paranoia (X1 = `paranoia`) when controlling for person’s general tendency to have delusions (X2 = `delusions`).

1.  Calculate **and report** the partial correlations for this scenario. For this exercise, your report can be as simple as: "The partial correlation is XXX."

2.  Explain the what partial correlation means.

```{r partial-correlation}



```

## Exercise 2:

We want to predict the tendency to believe in conspiracy theories (Y = `conspiracy`) from paranoia (X1 = `paranoia`) and delusional ideation (X2 = `delusions`). Take the following steps:

1.  Run a regression predicting the tendency to believe in conspiracy theories (Y = `conspiracy`) from paranoia (X1 = `paranoia`) and delusional ideation (X2 = `delusions`)

2.  Write out your interpretations of the overall model (both R<sup>2</sup> and the F-statistic) and each of the regression coefficients ($\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\beta_2$).

3.  Run regression diagnostics (i.e., `check_collinaerity()`) to look for potential multicollinaerity. Comment on what you find, but not need to try

4.  Provide an APA-style summary of your results (make sure it contains **all** necessary pieces, check lab for an example).

```{r regression-1}


```

## Exercise 3:

Treat the model you ran in Exercise 2 as Model 1. Make a new model, Model 2, that includes all the predictors in Model 1 plus the desire for uniqueness (`uniqueness`) and the desire for control (`control`).

Perform a model comparison to test whether the variation in the tendency to believe in conspiracy theories is accounted for by a desire for uniqueness and control (TOGETHER, AS A SET) *above and beyond* the variation already accounted for by paranoia and delusional ideation.

Treat the model you ran in Exercise 2 as Model 1. Make a new model, Model 2 (name it `model_2`), that includes all the predictors in Model 1 plus the desire for uniqueness (`uniqueness`) and the desire for control (`control`).

Perform a model comparison to test whether the variation in the tendency to believe in conspiracy theories is accounted for by a desire for uniqueness and control (together) *above and beyond* the variation already accounted for by paranoia and delusional ideation.

1.  Run a regression predicting the tendency to believe in conspiracy theories (Y = `conspiracy`) from paranoia (X1 = `paranoia`), delusional ideation (X2 = `delusions`), desire for uniqueness (`uniqueness`) and the desire for control (`control`). Call it `model_2`.

2.  Write out your interpretations of the overall model (both R<sup>2</sup> and the F-statistic) and each of the regression coefficients ($\beta_0$, $\beta_1$, and $\beta_2$).

3.  Run regression diagnostics (i.e., `check_collinaerity()`) on Model 2 to look for potential multicollinaerity. Comment on what you find, but not need to try to correct anything.

4.  Conduct a model comparison between Model 1 and Model 2. Answer the question: Does Model 2 explain significantly more variance in the tendency to believe in conspiracy theories than Model 1?

5.  Report the change in SSE between Model 1 and Model 2. Hint: we called this `ssr` in lab.

6.  Provide an APA-style summary of your results (make sure it contains **all** necessary pieces, check lab for an example).

```{r regression-2}




```
