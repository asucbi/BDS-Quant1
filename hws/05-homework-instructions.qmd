## Purpose

In this week's homework, you will be asked to demonstrate your understanding of contrast codes in regression analysis.

## Access the Starter Files for Module 5

-   Go to [posit.cloud](posit.cloud) and then **navigate to the course workspace** via the left sidebar.

    -   Look for the course workspace called "Statistical Methods Spring 2025"

-   Open the project titled **Module 5** This module contains the starter files that you will use for this lab and for your homework.

## Starter Files

In the Files pane you should see these two R Notebooks:

-   mod-05-lab-starter.qmd
-   mod-05-hw-starter.qmd

Open up `mod-05-hw-starter.qmd`.

## Render it!

Click the button called "Render" (circled in the image below) and then double check to see that your document rendered in the **Viewer** pane. It is always a good idea to occasionally check that the document still renders correctly after making changes.

## Load Packages

Today, we'll be using the following packages:

-   **tidyverse**: a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way
-   **papaja**: a package that supports the formatting of APA style documents
-   **emmeans**: a package for conducting post-hod t-tests
-   **knitr**: a package that supports the integration of code into text documents, we will be using it today to create a table

Please load these packages using the `library()` function. If the packages don't load, you may need to `install.packages()` first.

```{r load-packages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(papaja) #for formatting p values
library(emmeans) #for post-hoc t-tests
library(knitr) #for formatting tables
```

## Read in the Data

The data is called `depression_drug.csv`. Read in the data using the `read_csv()` function. Name the data "depression_drug".

The data has 2 columns:

-   drug: the drug dosage (if any) that the patient received
-   depress: participants' score on a depression measure

```{r read in data, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
depression_drug <- read_csv("data/depression_drug.csv")
```

::: callout-note
If you are having trouble reading in the data, remember that they are in the `data` folder!

Now, use the `View()` function to take a look at your data.

## Research Problem:

You are interested in the effectiveness of a new drug in treating the symptoms of depression. You randomly assign patients with depression into one of 3 treatment groups with different levels of the drug (low, medium, and high), and also one control group that only received a placebo. You then measure their symptoms after 4 weeks of drug treatment. You are interested in whether the drug is effective, and what level of the drug is most effective.

## Exercise 1:

Recreate (exactly) the following table.

```{r recreate-table, echo=FALSE}
depression_drug <- depression_drug %>% 
  mutate(drug = factor(drug, 
                       levels = c("none", "low", "medium", "high")))

depression_drug %>% 
  group_by(drug) %>%
  summarize(mean = mean(depression, na.rm = TRUE),
            sd = sd(depression, na.rm = TRUE),
            n = n()) %>% 
  knitr::kable(digits = 2) 
```

## Exercise 2:

Recreate (exactly) the following boxplot.

Answer this question: What pattern do you notice in the data?

```{r recreate-boxplot, echo=FALSE}

depression_drug %>% 
  ggplot(aes(drug, depression)) + 
  geom_boxplot() + 
  theme_minimal() + 
  labs(x = "Drug", y = "Depression")

```

## Exercise 3:

Run an omnibus ANOVA test to determine whether there is a relationship between `drug` and `depression`.

Answer this question: What does this tell you?

```{r omnibus-anova}




```

## Exercise 4:

Conduct *post-hoc* pairwise comparisons for `depression` scores across all levels of `drug`. Use a correction method to account for multiple comparisons.

```{r pariwise-comparisons}




```

## Exercise 5:

Run the regression again. This time, using your preferred method of dummy coding, test whether there is a significant difference between depression scores for each drug group (`low`, `medium`, `high`) and the `none` group. In this exercise you are being asked to compare low vs. none, medium vs. none, and high vs. none.

Write out the interpretation of each model coeffieient (do this *separately* from the summary).

Write an APA-style summary.

```{r drug-v-none}




```

## Exercise 6:

Now, rather than comparing each drug dosage to no drug separately, let's say we want to know whether the average of the three drug groups is different from the "none" group. What custom ("DIY") contrast codes would you use to test this comparison? Make sure your contrasts follow the rules for planned contrasts (you can reference the lecture slides or lab handout for this info!).

You do not need to run/interpret this model (just writing out the codes is enough)!

```{r diy-codes}




```

## Exercise 7:

Answer this question: What is the *most important* thing to remember about contrast codes?

```{r answer-question}




```

## Render and submit your document.

**Make sure that you I can see all of your answers in the rendered document!**
