## Purpose

In this week's homework you will be asked to generate another set of three sampling distributions and compare them. You will also demonstrate your ability to carry out the steps of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST).

## Access the Starter Files for Module 2

-   Go to [posit.cloud](posit.cloud) and then **navigate to the course workspace** via the left sidebar.

    -   Look for the course workspace called "Statistical Methods Spring 2025"

-   Open the project titled **Module 2** This module contains the starter files that you will use for this lab and for your homework.

## Starter Files

In the Files pane you should see these two R Notebooks:

-   mod-02-lab-starter.qmd
-   mod-02-hw-starter.qmd

Open up `mod-02-hw-starter.qmd`.

## Render it!

Click the button called "Render" (circled in the image below) and then double check to see that your document rendered in the **Viewer** pane. It is always a good idea to occasionally check that the document still renders correctly after making changes.

## Load Packages

Today, we'll be using the following packages:

-   **tidyverse**: a collection of packages for doing data analysis in a "tidy" way
-   **infer**: a package designed for statistical inference, we will be using it to generate "sample" datasets
-   **knitr**: a package that supports the integration of code into text documents, we will be using it today to create a table

Please load these packages using the `library()` function. If the packages don't load, you may need to `install.packages()` first.

```{r load-packages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse); library(infer); library(knitr)
```

## Step 4: Read in the Data

The data we will use in Module 2 is from the Gapminder Foundation, a non-profit that collects data about social, economic, and environmental development at local, national, and global levels. The data we will use today were collected in 2015.

Read in the data using the `read_csv()` function. Name the data "gapminder_2015"

```{r read in data, echo = FALSE, message=FALSE}
gapminder_2015 <- read_csv("data/gapminder_2015.csv")
```

::: callout-note
If you are having trouble reading in the data, remember that they are in the `data` folder!
:::

Now, use the `View()` function to take a look at your data.

**In lab we used the "infant_mortality" variable. For Exercise 1 we will be using the "life_expectancy" variable from that same dataset.**

::: callout-important
You must answer all questions and follow all steps in the homework document. Any time you see \[insert answer here\] in the starter file you need to replace that with the information that is being requested. To be eligible for full credit, please replace all \[insert answer here\] placeholders, answer all questions, and address all instructions in this document.
:::

## Exercise 1:

For this first exercise, please generate 10000 random samples of sizes 10, 50, and 150 from the life_expectancy distribution. For each sample, calculate the mean. Then, plot those 10000 means to examine the resulting sampling distributions. 

**Remember that we are now using the "life_expectancy" variable!**

Take a look at the data. What can you say about the shape of the distribution? If it is skewed, comment on the direction of the skew.

Compare the three plots, what does this show?

## Exercise 2:

Now, let's practice the steps of Null Hypothesis Significance Testing (NHST).

::: callout-note
There is no data to read in for this exercise.

A researcher is investigating whether people can subconsciously detect subtle emotional cues in facial expressions. Participants are presented with pairs of faces that differ very slightly in their expression (e.g., happy vs. sad). She shows participants pairs of faces, and they are asked to choose which face in each pair exhibits more positive emotion.

If people can subconsciously detect subtle emotional cues in facial expressions, then they should perform above chance (i.e., above 50%). The sample of 50 participants, on average, gets 54% of trials correct with a standard deviation of 15. Assume the standard deviation was calculated correctly for a sample (e.g., n-1 in the denominator).

**Step 1:** State the null and alternative hypotheses. Use *non-directional* hypotheses.

H~0~:

H~1~:

**Step 2:** Choose your alpha level. If you choose not to use $\alpha$ = .05, provide a justification.

$\alpha$:

**Step 3:** Collect your data.

We're going to pretend we already did this!

$\bar{x}$ =

*s* =

$\mu$ =

**Step 4:** Define the SEM for the sampling distribution. Report the SEM.

*SEM* = $\sigma$ / $\sqrt{n}$

**Step 5:** Determine the probability of your data or more extreme under the null distribution. Calculate the t-statistic and then generate a p-value using the `pt()` function.

*t* = ($\bar{x}$ - $\mu$) / *SEM*

**Step 6:** Compare your probability (p-value) to your alpha level and decide whether to reject or retain the null hypothesis.

**Step 7:** Write up your results summary. Make sure to include a Confidence Interval around your estimate of the mean.

95% CI = $\bar{x}$ ±(1.96 x SEM)

**Review the Lab Instructions for a reminder about the information that needs to be included in your summary!**

## Exercise 3:

Now, let's assume that the sample of 50 participants, on average, gets 56% of trials correct. Again we find a standard deviation of 15. You can still assume the standard deviation was calculated correctly for a sample (e.g., n-1 in the denominator).

Repeat steps 3 through 7 with the new observed mean value.

**Step 3:** Collect your data.

We're going to pretend we already did this!

$\bar{x}$ =

*s* =

$\mu$ =

**Step 4:** Define the SEM for the sampling distribution. Report the SEM.

*SEM* = $\sigma$ / $\sqrt{n}$

**Step 5:** Determine the probability of your data or more extreme under the null distribution. Calculate the t-statistic and then generate a p-value using the `pt()` function.

*t* = ($\bar{x}$ - $\mu$) / *SEM*

**Step 6:** Compare your probability (p-value) to your alpha level and decide whether to reject or retain the null hypothesis.

**Step 7:** Write up your results summary. Make sure to include a Confidence Interval around your estimate of the mean.

95% CI = $\bar{x}$ ±(1.96 x SEM)
