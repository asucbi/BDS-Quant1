## Purpose

In this week's homework, you will be asked to demonstrate your understanding of categorical x continuous interactions and continuous x continuous interactions.

## Load Packages

Please load these packages using the `library()` function. If the packages don't load, you may need to `install.packages()` first.

```{r load-packages, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(tidyverse)
library(papaja) #for formatting p values
library(psych) #for generating easy descriptives
library(emmeans) #for examining simple slopes
library(performance) #for checking multicollinaerity
library(knitr) #for formatting tables

```

## Data Summary

In today's exercises, we are interested in (1) whether the time students spend studying (`study_time`) interacts with test anxiety (`anxiety`, measured categorically) to predict students' test performance (`perf`) and (2) whether the time students spend studying (`study_time`) interacts with the previous test score (`prev_score`, measured continuously) to predict test performance.

## Read in the Data

The data file is called `test_perf.csv`. Read in the data, name it `test_perf`. Check it out using `View()`.

```{r}


```

The data has 4 columns:

-   perf: students' performance on the test
-   anxiety: students' text anxiety level (measured as high or low)
-   study_time: amount of time the student spent studying
-   prev_score: students' score on the prior test

## Exercise 1:

1. Run a model testing whether test anxiety moderates the relationship between time spent studying and test performance. Take steps to reduce multicollinearity before running the model. 

```{r} 

```

2. Interpret each of the model coefficients.  

3. Visualize the interaction using `ggplot`. Make sure to clearly label your axes.

```{r}

```

4. Test whether each simple slope is significantly different from 0. Answer the question: Which of the slopes are significantly different from zero?

```{r}

```

5. Test whether the simple slopes for low anxiety and high anxiety are significantly different from each other. Answer the question: Do the slopes differ significantly from each other?

```{r}

```

6. Write an APA style summary of your results. We have had a lot of practice extracting values from objects, and I know this can be tedious (though its a good skill to have!). If you would like to type out the numbers rather than extracting them from objects, that is fine. However, be careful to double-check your values! If you want to practice extracting values from objects, I encourage you to keep doing it!

7. Answer the questions: (a) What contrast codes were applied to the `anxiety` factor in the model you ran? (b) How would your interpretation of each of the coefficients change if you instead assigned these contrasts: -0.5 = low, 0.5 = high?

## Exercise 2:

1. Now, run a model testing whether students' previous test score moderates the relationship between time spent studying and test performance. Take steps to reduce multicollinearity before running the model. 

```{r}

```

2. Interpret each of the model coefficients.  


4. Write out the three equations for examining the effect of `prev_score` on `perf` at low, medium, and high levels of `study_time`.

```{r}

```

5. Use the `interact_plot()` function from the `{interactions}` package to plot the slope of `prev_score` on `perf` at low, medium, and high levels of `study_time`.

```{r}

```
6. Test whether the slope of `prev_score` on `perf` differs from zero across low, medium, and high levels of `study_time`?

```{r}

```

7. Write an APA style summary of your results. We have had a lot of practice extracting values from objects, and I know this can be tedious (though its a good skill to have!). If you would like to type out the numbers rather than extracting them from objects, that is fine. However, be careful to double-check your values! If you want to practice extracting values from objects, I encourage you to keep doing it!
